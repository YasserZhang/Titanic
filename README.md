## This is a test!!

##how to quit after commit a newer version with a message?
You're in the text editor, vim! It's a modal text editor, so you would need to:

Press i to enter insert mode.
Now you can type your message, as if you were in a normal (non-modal) text editor.
Press esc to go back to command mode.
Then type :w followed by enter to save.
Finally :q followed by enter to quit.
